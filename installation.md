######Notice that all hotkeys are unbound, except for Normal Cast, chat, glyph, and Console.

####Make sure to bind Normal Cast to Alt + _____ so that it shows in game:

####To unbind keys:
 1. click on the key to change its bind
 2. press \
 3. Repeat this for every hotkey, and notice that each one becomes unbound as you progress.
 4. Bind console to \ so that the other keys are left unbound.

###To run the config for the first time, type `exec autoexec` into the console. In the future if you update anything you can simply press F8 to reload it.

####GLHF!
